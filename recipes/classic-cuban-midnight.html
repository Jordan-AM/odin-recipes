    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Classic Cuban Midnight sandwich, or "Medianoche," is a savory blend of cooked pork, ham, Swiss cheese, pickles, and mustard, served on soft, sweet egg bread. It's a smaller, slightly sweeter cousin of the Cuban sandwich, perfect for late-night cravings. Traditionally pressed and grilled, it's a flavorful bite of Cuban comfort.</p>

        <li>
            On each sandwich, place and equal amount of Swiss cheese, ham and pork in exactly that order. Place a few pickles onto each one, and put the top of the roll onto the sandwich. Brush the tops with melted butter.

        <li>
            Press each sandwich in a sandwich press heated to medium-high heat. If a sandwich press is not available, use a large skillet over medium-high heat, and press the sandwiches down using a sturdy plate or skillet. Some indoor grills may be good for this also. Cook for 5 to 8 minutes, keeping sandwiches pressed. If using a skillet, you may want to flip them once for even browning.
